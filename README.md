### Dr.Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing DataCamp-project :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthrough discovery:
he discovered the importance of handwashing. Contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever,
and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital, he saved hundreds of lives.
